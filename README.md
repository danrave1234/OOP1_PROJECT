# OOP1_PROJECT
A java project for my OOP 1 course, I created this on my own and this is where i learned a lot of ideas. This is a game that has similar gameplay(only text based) of Axie infinity Origins gameplay mechanics where players get energy every turn and will be able to skip to save more energy and burst the opponent next round.
